# SecurePassword-Analyzer

Hi I'm **Tamilarasan S**, and this is a cybersecurity project I built as part of my learning.

## About the Project
**SecurePassword Analyzer** is a useful Python-based tool that helps users check:

- The **strength of their passwords**
- Whether the password has been exposed in a **data breach**
